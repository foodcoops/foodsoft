Running foodsoft in production
==============================

As you might have noticed, documentation is scarce and insufficient. If you
intend to deploy foodsoft in production, we would love to guide you through the
process. You can contact the mailing list
[foodsoft-discuss](http://foodsoft.51229.x6.nabble.com/foodsoft-discuss-f5.html),
or mail some of us directly at
[developers@foodcoop.nl](mailto:developers@foodcoop.nl) or foodsoft (at)
foodcoops.net.

* [Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) may be convenient.
* Redis is required for production by default.
