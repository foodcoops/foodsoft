Running Foodsoft in production
==============================

As you might have noticed, documentation is scarce and insufficient. If you
intend to deploy foodsoft in production, we would love to guide you through the
process. You can contact the mailing list
[foodsoft-discuss](http://foodsoft.51229.x6.nabble.com/foodsoft-discuss-f5.html).

Please see our wiki page: [Deployment notes](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/wiki/Deployment-notes).
