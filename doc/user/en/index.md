# Foodsoft Documentation

This written documentation consists of several parts. It is created, just like the Foodsoft software, by volunteer food coop enthusiasts free of charge in their spare time.

> Although we try our best, this documentation will probably never be perfect. Much of it was written by the authors from the perspective of using Foodsoft in their own food coop and in the situation in Austria with the great support of [IG Foodcoops](https://foodcoops.at). If you notice anything, please use the comment function to write a comment on how we could describe it better!
> Or, even better:
{.is-warning}

> This documentation is part of the Foodsoft Source Code. The content can be easily edited via the web browser: [Github](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft/edit/main/doc/user/). You are welcome to get access to collaborate and help complete the documentation. Please refer to the [guide](/en/documentation/development/howtowrite).
{.is-info}

> This manual is intended for all people who are interested in Foodsoft. For reasons of readability, however, only the female form is used for **gender-specific terms** - except where terms are stored differently in Foodsoft (e.g. "Benutzer/innen", "Lieferanten" - here the terms of Foodsoft are used for clarity).

## Foodsoft Administration

What Foodsoft can do, how it can support your food coop, and how you can set it up. Even in the day-to-day operation of the food coop, Foodsoft needs administrators who take care of the background tasks, ensuring that there are regular orders, that articles in Foodsoft are up-to-date, and that orders are billed and supplier invoices are paid.

> Why "advertise" alternative options in a documentation for Foodsoft? In case someone has strayed here, for example, looking for documentation for the Foodcoopshop, or wants to get an overview of Foodsoft apps, or just wants to know what this "other Foodsoft" is all about.
