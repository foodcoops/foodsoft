# Tutorial - How to order products
This tutorial will help you through the process of ordering products.

## Find the order on which you want to participate
The foodsoft collects orders of the individual members, or order groups, into a single order.

You have two choices:
- The dashboard will show you a section `Current orders` on top.
- Navigate to `Orders -> Place order!`.

There you will find all orders you can currently participate in.

## Place your order
- For every article you wish to order, press the `+`-button until you've reached the desired amount.
- Click `Save order`.
- You're done!

## Collect your products
Once the ordered products are received, you can pick them up, assuming that all of them were delivered. Read more about it in the upcoming tutorial "How to pick up your products".

## Unit quantities and tolerances
Some units (e.g. beverages or special bakery goods) can only be ordered in bulk, i.e. not as single items. Luckily, your foodcoop can order a big quantity together and share it amongst the members! The foodsoft knows how to handle the process, so **you can order products as usual!**

There is no guarantee that you will be able to fill up the required unit quantity, though. Note that he foodsoft highlights a product in...
- *red* when the product hasn't been requested sufficiently often to reach (a multiple of) the required unit quantity.
- *yellow* when just one more unit needs to be ordered to reach the unit quantity.
- *green* when the unit quantity has been reached.

### Tolerances
To rough out the edges of a bulk order, you can use "Tolerances". You basically place a flexible order that will be used to fill up the required unit quantity if needed, and will be ignored if not needed.

For example, assume your coop would order beer, which only comes in crates of 12 bottles. The description of the beer product will therefore contain `Units: 12 * bottle` or similar.
- Let us assume that you want to order 4 to 6 bottles, meaning that you really need 4 bottles,   but in case it helps to gather a whole crate you're fine with one or two extra bottles.
- You would then press the `+`-button in the column `Amount` for 4 times.
- Now, to express that you're fine with at most 2 extra bottles, press the `+`-button in the column `Tolerance` for 2 times.
- That's it for you!

Let's assume that your friend orders exactly 7 bottles (and no tolerance), and that's it. Then the total order amounts to 11 bottles with 2 tolerance, which means that the unit quantity of 12 bottles has been reached, within tolerance! Yay!

Once the 12 bottles arrive, the foodcoop will distribute 7 bottles to your friend, and 5 (= 4 + 1 tolerance) bottles to you. Cheers!

## Available credit
The foodsoft never lets you order more products than your credit allows. Even orders that you haven't picked up yet are included in the calculation.
