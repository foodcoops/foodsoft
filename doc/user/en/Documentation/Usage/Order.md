# Order
## The general idea
The principle of foodsoft is that to receive their products, the cells associate to place **orders** to the suppliers. That's how it goes:
- An order list corresponding to a supplier, for example 'Sugar and services', is first put online by a member of the Boufcoop,
- this list remains accessible for a certain time to all the members, who can choose the quantity of the different products that they wish to order,
- on the scheduled date, the order is closed, we can not change it anymore,
- a person then takes care of recovering the quantities of each product and to contact the supplier,
- the products are delivered. It happens that the delivery does not correspond exactly to the order (errors, products unavailable, misunderstandings, last minute price change, losses ...).
- the products are distributed among the cells, remaining as close as possible to their initial wishes,
- a person carefully compares the actual quantities received by each cell and their orders, and makes the final **count** of the order.

Orders can be in three states: **in progress**, **closed** or **counted**. The countdown phase allows to make sure that what is paid for by the cells corresponds to what they have received. It is explained more in detail in the section [finance](/en/Documentation/General/Finance). To order, each cell has some credit. The current credit of your cell is displayed on your dashboard. More detailed information is provided on the page *Placing an order*, accessible under the *Commands* tab of the main menu. The credit is broken down into three parts:
- credit committed to ongoing orders,
- credit committed in orders already closed, but not yet counted,
- available credit
## To order
Once on the page *Place an order*, accessible under the tab *Orders* of the main menu, if you click on the name of a supplier for whom he exits an order in progress, you land on the order list. The inset at the top left contains some useful information about the order:
- the person who created the list,
- the planned closing date, from which the order will not be modifiable,
- the amount already committed by all the cells on this order,
- the available credit of your cell.

### Choose products
You will find below this insert the list of products offered for this order. It's not necessarily about of all the products of the supplier-e, since the person who creates the order list has had the possibility to select only a subset (see [Order management](/en/Documentation/Administration/Orders)).

For each product, you must choose the number of units you want to order. The unit varies according to the product (1kg, 75cl, ...), and is therefore indicated in the column *unit* of the table (4th column). The price of a unit is shown in the column *price* (3rd column). To increase or decrease the number of units you want for your cell, use the + and - buttons of the 6th column (quantity).

As the products are offered by the supplier-e in the form of lots (see [Units and lots](/en/Documentation/Administration/Products#units-and-lots)), as long as it is missing units to complete the current batch, you are not sure to receive the product. This number is displayed in the 5th column (*Missing*). The number of units you are not sure to receive appears in red, while the number that appears in green is safe.

### Tolerance
The quantity that you indicate as *tolerance* is a maximum that you are ready to receive, in addition to the quantity ordered normally, in case it allows to complete a lot at the time of the closing of the order. If there is no lot to complete, this quantity will simply be ignored. Putting a non-zero tolerance when your orders is beneficial for all of the boufcoop, as this increases the chances of completing some lots that otherwise could not be ordered. Moreover, it can even encourage other people who need more of the product than you to order, because you will give them more hope that the lot is completed.

> **Example**:
> 
> The banana cell really needs 3 chocolate chips. But chocolate can not be delivered
> only in batches of 8 platelets. Banana therefore orders 3 pads, plus a tolerance of 2, the maximum
> that she can afford to pay, hoping that another cell will complete the order.
> 
> The next day, Fig cell sees this. It only needs one plate, and the command
> so. At this point there are 4 pads in firm order, plus a tolerance of 2, so the lot does not
> can still not be completed! Fortunately, the Apple cell sees that only two are missing
> platelets to complete the lot, she is sure to have her chocolate. She orders three plates.
> 
> The coop receives 8 platelets. Fig and Apple have their platelets ordered, and so
> 4. Banane receives his 3 platelets, plus 1 bonus, which fits well in his margin of tolerance.
> Everyone is happy, whereas if nobody had indicated tolerance, the delivery would not have
> maybe not even possible!
