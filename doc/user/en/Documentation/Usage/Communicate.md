# Communicate
## Wiki
The Wiki is accessible from the main foodsoft menu. It is often used to publish reports meetings and internal documentation explaining the operation of the Foodcoop.

To create a new page, go to *All Pages*, then *Create New Page*. Then write the content in using the formatting wizard on the right to get a nice rendering. Unfortunately the current version does not allow to insert images.

## Messaging
The *Internal Messaging* is accessible from the main menu, under the *Boufcoop* tab. Its operation is similar to that of a forum. When sending a message, it can be sent to all members of the same cell or the same team. Members can configure their profile to receive or not these messages in their mailbox, or only on Foodsoft.
