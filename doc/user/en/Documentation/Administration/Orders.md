# Order management
The *Order Management* page is accessible under the *Orders* tab of the main menu, but only if you are part of a team that has access to it. This option can be configured by an administrator in the parameters of each team.

## Define a new order
To define a new command, click on the button at the top right of the page, and select the name of a email provider. You can then choose the dates of opening and closing of the order, as well as the articles that you wish to make it appear. The list of articles can be modified from [products](/en/Documentation/Administration/Products). A Once the command has been created, it will appear in the current command list and the cells will be able to start order.

## Closing and sending
To close the order, click the *Close* button from the *Order Management* page. The date closure is given as an indication, orders must always be closed manually. Once order closed, you land on the summary page of the quantities ordered. You can also access this page from the *Order Management*, by clicking the *Show* button to the right of the closed order desired.

The most convenient way to transmit the order to the supplier is the *Fax in PDF*, accessible from the menu *Download* (even if you send it by email and not by fax). Indeed, the table obtained simply summarizes the number of lots to be ordered for each product, as well as the price, but does not mention the distribution between the cells (which does not usually interest the supplier).

## Reception and verification
Once delivery has arrived safely, it may be wise to check its contents to take into account any changes to the order (unavailable products, price changes ...). The button *Receive* accessible from the *Order Management* page validates this verification step. The table that appears summarizes the quantities ordered for each product, and you must enter in the adequate column the quantity actually received after verification. By clicking on the *Edit* button, you can even change the price of each product if it turned out that there was an error. Finally, we can even add a product to the list if the delivery contains products that were not present in the order list (gifts, last minute changes ...).

If you wish, you can leave comments (at the bottom of the order management page) to keep track of all these changes, which can be useful when counting and billing (see [finance](/en/Documentation/General/Finance)).

## Distribution between cells
To help with the distribution between cells, it is best to download the *Distribution Matrix PDF*, accessible from the menu *Download* on the summary page of any closed order. The PDF file that you will get first consists of a table of products and their quantities, then a large double table entry, whose columns are the products, and the lines are the items, with at the intersection the number of units of each product that the corresponding cell must receive.

If there are problems with the distribution, it may be useful to note it also in the comments of the command.
