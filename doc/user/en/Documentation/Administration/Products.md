# Products
The directory is one of the key elements of the Boufcoop, since this is where all the suppliers' contacts and information about their products are stored.

## Supplier-e-s
The *directory* is accessible under the *Products* tab of the main menu. To *add a supplier-e*, click on the blue button at the top right of the page, then enter the data you want in the form. The *customer number of the coop* is useful for wholesalers, who assign a number that must be recalled at the time of each order. The *how to order* field is used to specify the means by which the supplier wishes to be contacted. After validation, the e-provider will appear immediately in the *directory*, and the information can be *modified* by clicking the corresponding button in front of its name.

## products
The information on the products offered by a supplier is accessible by clicking on the link *Articles ()* in front of its name in the *directory*. To add a *new product*, click on the blue button at the top left of the list of products of a supplier, and fill in the form that appears.

### Units and lots
Most suppliers offer their wholesale packaged products, such as bags of 25kg of flour, or lots of 12 jars of honey. These **lots** will then be distributed among the different cells. In Foodsoft, the **unit** is the smallest amount of product that can be ordered by a cell. The choice of a relevant unit depends of course on the product under consideration. For example, for flour a unit of 1kg may be a good choice, while for saffran it could be 1g. Once this choice is made, each batch then contains a certain number of units (for example 25 units of 1kg in a 25kg bag).

### Category
The categories help to improve the readability of orders for suppliers offering a lot of products. Apart from that they have no influence. They can be configured from the *Categories* page on the *Products* tab of the main menu.

### order
The deposit is an additional price invoiced by the supplier for containers delivered with the order (bottles, crates). In general, these containers are recovered at the next delivery, and the deposit is refunded at that time.

### Availability
To avoid deleting a product that is unavailable only temporarily (for reasons of exhaustion of stock or seasonality), one or more products may be *marked as unavailable* by ticking the box to the left of their name and using the drop-down list at the bottom of the list.

## Shared directory
It makes it possible to share information on the suppliers of the same region between several boufcoops. To access it, click on the white button at the top right of the *directory* page, accessible under the *Products* tab of the main menu. If a shared directory has been configured during the installation of Foodsoft, you will see the list of suppliers. To access it in your boufcoop, you just have to *subscribe*.
