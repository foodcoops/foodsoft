# Administer
Administration functions are only available to teams for which the necessary permissions have been enabled.

## Adding a cell
The list of *cells* is accessible under the *Administration* tab of the main menu. To *Define a new cell*, click on the blue button at the top right of the page, and fill in the form. The best is to leave the *Members* field empty, and invite members by email as specified below.

## New members
If a person wishes to join the boufcoop, it must obligatorily join a cell. To add new members, the best way is to invite them directly to join a cell. If the person does not want to join any of the already existing cells, we must start by creating one. Next, click on the *Edit* button in front of the cell name in the list, then click on the *Prompt new members here* link at the top of the page. Enter the person's email address in the form that appears, and then click *Send invitation*. The person will then receive a message containing the information necessary to register. She can then enter her personal data and start using Foodsoft.

## Team management
Teams are created and composed from the *Teams* page under the *Administration* tab of the main menu. To *Define a new team*, click on the blue button at the top right of the page. Choose a *name*, and enter a *description* of the role of the team. Then check the boxes corresponding to the Foodsoft features that this team will have access to. Then, for each member who will be part of the team, start typing the first letters of are ID in the *Members* field, then click on the ID in the drop-down that appears.

## Member data
The *members* database is also accessible under the *Administration* tab of the main menu. However, it is rare for the admin- istrative to directly modify this information, which is generally the responsibility of the members themselves.
