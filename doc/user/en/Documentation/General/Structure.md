# Structure of the foodcoop
## Members
The coop is first and foremost constituted by its members. Each member has a protected user account, protected by a password. Your user profile can be configured from the menu with the small arrow at the top right of any what page. You can
- make available to other members information to contact you (email, phone ...),
- change your password,
- choose your language from those available,
- define your privacy options,
- choose the warning emails you will receive from foodsoft in different cases.

## cells
The cells are groups of members who have decided to associate to place their orders together (often because they live or at least cook together) Every member of the coop must be a member of a cell to be able to control. For the moment, a user-eur-ice account can only belong to one cell at a time. If a member wants to order via several cells, so he needs several accounts.

You can access a summary of information about *your cell* by clicking on your login at the top right of any page of the site. However, to modify the contact data (address, etc.), you must contact a person who administers the site.

## teams
The teams are groups of members who have decided to associate to carry out regularly certain types of jobs together. A member can easily belong to multiple teams. The grouping in team is useful to better organize jobs, to communicate in small groups without spammer all the members, and also allows much better readability for new-members. Another team interest is that access permissions to foodsoft pages can be restricted according to belonging to a team, which allows to avoid false manipulations, and also not to drown all-e-s members with features that are not useful to them.

Be careful to note the difference between a team and a cell: each member is part of a cell, which has some credit to pay the orders, while a team (eg the distribution team) deals with useful jobs at the boufcoop. The members always belong to one and only one cell, but can be part of several teams.
