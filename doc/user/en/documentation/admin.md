# Foodsoft Administration

What Foodsoft can do, how it can support your food coop, and how you can set it up. Even in the day-to-day operation of the food coop, Foodsoft needs administrators who take care of things in the background, ensuring that there are regular items to order, that articles in Foodsoft are up-to-date, and that orders are billed.
