# Deposits in the Food Coop

Many producers take back empty containers for reuse. Some charge a deposit to cover the cost of the container in case of loss and to encourage its return, while others find this effort too high and trust that the empty container will be returned even without a deposit.

> In all variants, trust in the members of the food coop is necessary so that the food coop does not suffer any financial damage. It is important to inform the members well about this. The simpler the system, the higher the chances that it will work and no one will have to pay extra.
