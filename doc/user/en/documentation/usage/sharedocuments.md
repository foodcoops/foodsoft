# Foodsoft Wiki Pages for Information Collection

## Why a Wiki?

The Foodsoft Wiki is a collection of text pages within Foodsoft that can be read and edited by all members. It is suitable for recording and structurally collecting food cooperative-specific information, so that members who join later can also get an overview, and there is easily accessible, structured documentation of food cooperative-specific information for everyone.

The advantages of the wiki are:
- always viewable for all members via Foodsoft
- editable by everyone: every member can add something, correct, ...
- information can be structured and is easier to retrieve compared to emails, even for those who join later
- supplement to email communication: create information like instructions in the wiki and send a link to the wiki page via email.
- create documents together: instead of sending a text document back and forth via email, everyone always sees and edits the same current version of the wiki page.

Examples of possible content are:

- Information about producers and products, storage room and processes in the food cooperative
- Responsibilities: who is responsible for what
- Board: persons, meeting minutes, ...
- Collection of ideas, working out texts together

> All versions of wiki pages are saved when editing and can be viewed and restored at any time. This means no information can be lost, even if something is (accidentally) deleted.

There is a separate menu for the wiki with a link to the homepage and an overview of all wiki pages

## Wiki Lists

A text paragraph is achieved by a blank line. A new line without a blank line is ignored. For lists, it's best to use a list, as the following example shows:

```
Point 1
Point 2
Point 3
```

is undesirably displayed as
> Point 1 Point 2 Point 3

Better in the form of a list with a `*` at the beginning of each line:

```
* Point 1
* Point 2
* Point 3
```

Is displayed as

* Point 1
* Point 2
* Point 3

## Edit Wiki Homepage

Menu *Wiki > Homepage > edit*.

Wiki pages consist only of text, but there are special text character arrangements that cause formatting. The most important ones are displayed on the right during editing.

> Tip: Use headings and lists with links to create a kind of table of contents of the wiki on the homepage.

## Create New Wiki Page

Edit page (e.g., homepage) and create page title in square brackets, for page title "Grain Mill" so e.g., `[[Grain Mill]].` This creates a link to a page that doesn't exist yet. When you save the current page and click this link, you can create and edit the new page.

> The page title is automatically displayed as a heading, so you don't need to start your page with a heading, but only use headings for subdivision into individual sections.

## Wiki Structure

Tree structure by selecting a parent page
- Path display allows going back
- Overview page shows subpages indented under the parent pages

# Document Storage in Foodsoft

Here documents can be uploaded and made available for download, but not edited (the wiki is better suited for this).

Examples:

- Forms like membership application
- Documents like company register extract, statutes
- Producer price lists

Possible file formats are:

- PDF
- Images
