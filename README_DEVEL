README for DEVELopment Project Setup
====================================

Gratulations, you have successfully cloned the foodsoft project
from the git repository. Now you are only a few steps away from
trying it out and then jumping into development. (This manual presumes
you have ruby and rails setup.)

(1) Configure datebase
----------------------
Create the database configuration from the default:

    cp config/database.yml.SAMPLE config/database.yml

If you are fine with using a file-based sqlite database you are all set.
The sqlite files (development/test/production) will reside in the "db" directory.
You might still need to install sqlite and the respective gem, i.e. on Ubuntu do:

    sudo aptitude install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
    sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

Otherwise you would want to edit database.yml to suit your needs (MySQL whatever).
	

(2) Configure development environment
-------------------------------------
Again, you need to create your own copy of the default configuration:

	cp config/environments/development.rb.SAMPLE config/environments/development.rb

Edit development.rb to specify your settings (at least the ActionMailer SMTP settings).
If you just leave the file as is, emails will not work but everything else should be okay.


(3) Foodsoft settings
---------------------
You need to create your own copy of the foodsoft configuration settings:

	cp config/app_config.yml.SAMPLE config/app_config.yml

Edit app_config.yml to suit your needs or just keep the defaults for now.


(4) Required gems
-------------------
In addition to the standard Ruby on Rails gems you will need to install 
the additional gems required by running:

    sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    sudo gem install haml fastercsv prawn rubyist-aasm


(5) Create database schema
--------------------------
	rake db:schema:load


(6) Create user "admin" with password "secret"
----------------------------------------------
	rake foodsoft:create_admin
	

(7) Try it out!
---------------	
Start the WEBrick server to try it out:
	
	script/server
